MongoDBVagrant
==============

In this package is a Vagrant Controlled Centos 7 MongoDB Database. I have cleared the iptables so all services are exposed to the outside and as usually the vagrant user id can log in and su to root to run the service. 

This installation really isn't suitable for external use for many reasons.

Refer to [MongoDB Documents](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/) to run the server and configure it.
